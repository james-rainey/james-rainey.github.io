<h2>Who Benefits from INFORM?</h2>
<hr>
<p>
The INFORM system is initially designed for implementation within hospital environments, where precise monitoring of food waste and nutritional intake can play a crucial role in improving patient health outcomes. By tracking what patients consume and identifying patterns in food preferences or waste, the system supports healthcare providers in tailoring meals to individual dietary needs, enhancing patient satisfaction, and reducing unnecessary food production. In the long term, INFORM contributes to maintaining high standards of food quality and delivery efficiency, fostering a more sustainable and cost-effective food management process across the healthcare setting.

</div>
-->
<p>
While INFORM is initially designed for hospital settings, its potential applications extend far beyond healthcare. The system can be seamlessly adapted to any environment where food is prepared and served, offering valuable insights and benefits across a range of industries.
</p>

<p>
In school canteens, for instance, INFORM could play a key role in promoting healthier eating habits among students. By monitoring food choices, consumption patterns, and waste levels, schools can better understand what children are eating, and what they’re not. This information can be used to design more appealing, nutritious menus and to support educational initiatives around balanced diets and sustainability.
</p>
<p>
Similarly, in restaurants and catering establishments, INFORM offers both owners and customers a consistent, data-driven measure of food quality and portion control. Restaurant managers can use this data to refine menu offerings, reduce waste, and maintain consistent standards, while diners benefit from enhanced transparency and confidence in the food they’re served.
</p>
<p>
By bridging the gap between technology, nutrition, and sustainability, INFORM has the potential to revolutionize how food quality and consumption are monitored across diverse sectors, from education and hospitality to corporate dining and beyond.
</p>


<h2>How does it work?</h2>
<hr>
<p>
The INFORM system is built around a sophisticated array of integrated sensors that work together to identify food items, measure their temperature, and determine the precise weight of each component on a plate. This multi-sensor approach enables the system to capture comprehensive data about every meal with remarkable speed and accuracy.
</p>

    </div>
</div>
<div class="caption">

</div>


<p>
Each plate used within the system is embedded with a unique identification tag, allowing INFORM to instantly recognize it as soon as it is placed on the platform. Once detected, the system automatically initiates the food recognition process. In just a few seconds, INFORM identifies all food items present, calculates their individual weights, and records their temperatures, all with an impressive accuracy rate exceeding 90%.
</p>
<p>
This seamless automation not only ensures reliable data collection but also minimizes human error, creating a more efficient workflow for food service operations. The result is a fast, precise, and intelligent system that supports improved quality control, nutrition tracking, and waste management.
</p>


<h2>Actionable Results</h2>
<hr>
<p>
When a plate is returned after a meal, the same intelligent scanning process is performed again. By comparing the data captured before and after eating, the INFORM system can automatically determine how much food has been consumed and how much has been wasted. From these comparisons, detailed insights are generated, including precise measurements of food waste, nutritional intake, and the associated cost of the uneaten food.
</p>
<p>
This valuable data is then processed and distributed to the relevant stakeholders in a clear and actionable format via the INFORM dashboard. For example, dietitians can access nutritional data to better understand patient consumption patterns and adjust meal plans accordingly, while kitchen managers and food suppliers can review food quality and waste metrics to refine menus, improve portion control, and enhance operational efficiency.
<p>
Through this closed-loop feedback system, INFORM not only provides real-time visibility into food consumption and waste but also supports data-driven decision-making across multiple levels of the foodservice and healthcare ecosystem.

<h2>Evaluation</h2>
<hr>
<p>
A comprehensive series of tests has been carried out to evaluate the INFORM system’s performance, both in controlled settings and real-world environments.
Initial testing took place in-house at Falcon, where engineers assessed the system’s technical capabilities, accuracy, and reliability under laboratory conditions. These trials allowed the team to fine-tune the AI algorithms and optimize hardware integration for consistent results.
</p>
<p>
Further evaluations were then conducted in a live kitchen environment at Newcastle University, providing valuable insights into how the system performs in everyday operational scenarios. This real-world testing phase highlighted INFORM’s ability to adapt to variable lighting, diverse food presentations, and the fast-paced nature of a working kitchen. Together, these tests have been instrumental in validating the system’s robustness, usability, and readiness for wider deployment.

<h2>What's Next?</h2>
<hr>
<p>
The next stage for INFORM is all about putting the system into the hands of real users and demonstrating its value in everyday settings. By moving beyond the lab and into real-world environments, INFORM can showcase how it streamlines operations, reduces waste, and delivers meaningful insights that drive better decisions. Gathering feedback from users will also play a key role in refining and enhancing the system to ensure it meets the practical needs of healthcare professionals and organizations.

Looking ahead, the potential for INFORM extends far beyond its current applications. The system could be adapted for use across a wide range of industries where food monitoring, waste reduction, and nutrition tracking are critical. Future developments may include integration with smart kitchen equipment such as connected ovens, advanced analytics that evolve through continuous data collection, and the creation of a mobile app for real-time access and convenience. With these innovations, INFORM aims to become a leading solution in data-driven food management and sustainability.
