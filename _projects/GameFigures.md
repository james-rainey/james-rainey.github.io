## Dota 2 Figures

In my spare time I like to play Dota 2, and when I'm not in the mood for playing I like to print and paint models of my favourite characters.


I have been working on two characters so far, Elder Titan and Undying.
These are two of my favourite and most played characters and so were obvious first choices to print first.

<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/3DPrinting/ET1_v2.jpg" title="Elder Titan raw print." class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/3DPrinting/ET_UD1_v2.jpg" title="Elder Titan and Undying together." class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/3DPrinting/UD1_v2.jpg" title="Undying raw print." class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>
<div class="caption">

Just off the printer the quality is a bit rough, as I'm using a 0.4mm nozzle they are not as finely detailed as possible, but after a little sanding to remove some rough areas they still have a lot of detail that can be enhanced when they are painted.

But before I get the to painting the detail, I have to prime them.
For the main models I use a basic grey primer and the result is quite good, the print lines are filled in and gives a good surface to paint onto.

For the Elder Titan model I also printed a detachable weapon and back piece. The prints on these had a few deeper, more visible print lines so I used a yellow primer filler which was able to fill in these gaps nicely.

    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/3DPrinting/ET2_v2.jpg" title="Elder Titan Primed" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}

Now onto the fun part: painting.
