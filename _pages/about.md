I’m a **Computer Vision Researcher** passionate about building intelligent systems that enable machines to see, understand, and interact with the world. My work focuses on developing AI-powered vision solutions that seamlessly bridge the gap between **cutting-edge research** and **real-world applications**, turning complex ideas into practical, high-impact systems.

With experience in both research and industry, I specialise in taking innovative concepts from prototype to fully functional systems. I’ve contributed to projects across a variety of domains, including:

[Food Recognition](projects/) – developing systems that understand and classify food images.
[Neuromorphic Vision](projects/) – exploring brain-inspired vision systems for efficient processing.
[Media Authenticity](projects/) – detecting deepfake images and verifying visual content integrity.
[Gait Recognition](projects/GaitRecognition) – analyzing human motion for identification and forensic applications.

I’m skilled in **Python** and modern deep learning frameworks, with a strong track record of building robust applications. My research has resulted in a growing number of **publications in computer vision**, and I enjoy collaborating on initiatives that push the boundaries of AI while delivering meaningful real-world impact.

Beyond my professional work, I’m fascinated by hands-on technology and creative experimentation. I spend my free time exploring [3D printing](projects/3DPrinting), Raspberry Pi [projects](projects/), and other maker activities that allow me to prototype ideas, tinker with hardware, and bring abstract concepts to life.

Ultimately, I’m driven by **curiosity**, **creativity**, and a desire to apply AI and computer vision in ways that make a _tangible_ difference. Whether through research, development, or collaborative projects, I strive to combine **technical excellence** with **innovative thinking** to solve challenging problems and create impactful solutions.
