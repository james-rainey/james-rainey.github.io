I’m a passionate and driven Computer Vision Researcher with a strong background in developing advanced AI-powered vision solutions. Skilled in Python and experienced in building applications that move seamlessly from research to real-world deployment, I enjoy tackling complex challenges and turning theoretical concepts into practical, impactful systems.

Along the way, I’ve contributed to both research and commercial projects, combining creativity with technical expertise to deliver results. My work has led to a growing publication record in computer vision, and I’m always eager to collaborate on innovative ideas that push the field forward.

<!---Currently working on an INtelligent FOod Recognition and Montitoring system ([INFORM](projects/INFORM/)) and preparing upcoming [INFORM Workshop](INFORM_Workshop/).-->
I have worked on projects in food recognition, [Neuromorphic Vision](projects/NEVIS), Media Authenticity and Gait Recognition.


I also enjoy working on [3D Printing](projects/3D_printing) and Raspberry Pi based [projects](projects/) in my spare time.
