<h2>Background</h2>
<hr>
<p>
Every year, hospitals and healthcare facilities across the UK serve around 141 million meals, but as many as 30 million of these go uneaten. In NHS hospitals alone, up to 18% of food may be wasted, roughly one in every six meals. This not only affects environmental sustainability but also impacts patient care, as nutritious meals play a vital role in recovery and wellbeing.
</p>
<p>
At the same time, malnutrition remains a growing concern, particularly among older adults. More than 160,000 people over 75 in UK care homes are estimated to be malnourished, a challenge that already accounts for around 15% of total health and social care spending.
</p>

<h2>Purpose</h2>
<hr>
<p>
The purpose of the INFORM workshop is to provide participants with a comprehensive understanding of the INFORM system by showcasing its features, demonstrating its practical applications, and discussing its potential uses and advantages. The workshop aims to engage an audience of professionals, stakeholders, and decision-makers who can directly benefit from adopting or integrating this technology into their work. Through interactive demonstrations and open discussions, attendees will gain insights into how INFORM can improve efficiency, enhance decision-making, and support their organizational goals.
</p>
<!---
The INFORM workshop is designed to give participants an up-close look at the INFORM system—how it works, what it can do, and the real-world benefits it offers. During the session, attendees will see live demonstrations, explore practical examples, and join in conversations about how this technology can make their work easier and more effective. Whether you’re curious about innovative tools or looking for ways to enhance your organization’s performance, this workshop will show how INFORM can make a meaningful difference.
